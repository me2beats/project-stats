# project-stats

A plugin for Godot Engine 3, that shows some statistics info for your projects.
It was made during Godot Addons Jam!

You can see a dialog box with some stats. I plan to add some other parameters later.
You can choose which info you would like to be shown



As a cool bonus, there is an option to see your Coding time right in Output panel.
You can also choose colors.


Preferences are saved in EditorSettings (me2beats_plugins page), so you don't need to set them in a new project.

The code waits to be refactored, I plan to continue develop it and add some new stats a bit later, feature requests are welcomed :)
